<h3>Server</h3>

<p>
  Computers connected to the Internet are called <em>servers</em>.

  Servers that accept requests specifically from programs like a web-browser are called <strong>web-servers</strong>.

  When a request comes in, the server processes the request and sends back content that will make up the web-page you see.
