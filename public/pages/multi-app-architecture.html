<h3>Multi-app Architecture</h3>
<p>
  Now we can add another app-server into our architecture.
  The reverse-proxy receives requests and delegates them out to our app-servers behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
  This is called scaling <em>horizontally</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Scaling horizontally is usually very cost effective because it's cheaper to buy many commodity servers than a few powerful servers.
</p>

<p>
  It also mitigates risk; if you only have one powerful server and it fails, your site goes down. Many servers means some can fail and the others will pick up the load.
