<h3>Web Server</h3>

<p>
  A web-server is just a computer, so it needs to run software to carry out specific tasks.
</p>

<p>
  In order to accept web-requests (requests coming in over the Internet) the server runs a software program called a <strong>web-server</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The web-server software program is important because it dictates which files and programs are OK to to be accessed from the Internet.
</p>

<p>
  There will always be private files and data you don't want to allow outside access to, so when outside requests come in they are handled <em>only</em> by the web-server which acts as a kind of security gate.
