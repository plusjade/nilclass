<h3>Database</h3>

<p>
  A web application can interact with a <strong>database</strong>: a software program installed on the server that helps with efficiently storing and accessing data.
</p>
<p>
  We can use a database to store Amazon's millions of products as data: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>description</li>
  <li>price</li>
  <li>sizes</li>
  <li>images</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The web application can use this database to create the product pages on-demand.
  The app makes a query to the database for product data then uses the data to populate a page template that has placeholder values like {price}, {description}, etc.
</p>

<p>
  Now if you want change the product template, you only have to change one file. =)
