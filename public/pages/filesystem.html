<h3>Serving Content</h3>
<p>
  Web pages are essentially just media like videos, images, and text.
</p>
<p>
  Web pages on Youtube allow you to see videos, Instagram displays images, and Spotify streams audio files.
</p>
<p>
  The simplest way to send this content to the user is for the web-server to retrieve it from its own <strong>filesystem</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The filesystem is just like the folders and files found on your own personal computer.
