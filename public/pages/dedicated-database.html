<h3>Dedicated Database</h3>
<p>
  Up until this point, all our software programs have been running on <em>one</em> physical server.

  But each server has physical limits in how many requests it can handle.
</p>

<p>
  To handle more requests, or <em>scale</em> your application, the first thing you can do is move your database software to its own <strong>dedicated database server</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Now your app server can concentrate on serving web-requests, while your database-server gets more computing power to manage the database.
