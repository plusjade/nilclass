<h3>Web Application</h3>
<p>
  If a web-server serves files from its filesystem, does that mean there is one file for every single web page on the Internet?
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> has web pages for millions of products. Creating millions of files would take forever and be hard to maintain. 
  Updating the product page layout would require changing every single file!
</p>

<p>
  Instead the web-server can serve an <strong>application</strong> (web-app) rather than files.
  The web-server routes the web-request to the web-application software program.
</p>

<p>
  The web application can do work <em>on demand</em> like reading from a template file or skeleton and building a custom page <em>dynamically</em>.
</p>

<p>
  This means web pages don't actually have to exist, a software program can create them as needed.
